          Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval
          world. Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role
          playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves,
          monsters, etc. The game makes players feel they are traveling the
          world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that
          will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command. Along
          the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other
          and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.
          <br /><br />
          Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to
          the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds
          trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions. They will also
          improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and
          battles with fantasy creatures and each other. Once they complete a
          Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its
          challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of
          Command. Then the other players must race to stop this player before
          he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.
