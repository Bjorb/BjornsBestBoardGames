          In Tokaido, each player is a traveler crossing the "East sea road",
          one of the most magnificent roads of Japan. While traveling, you will
          meet people, taste fine meals, collect beautiful items, discover great
          panoramas, and visit temples and wild places but at the end of the
          day, when everyone has arrived at the end of the road you'll have to
          be the most initiated traveler – which means that you'll have to be
          the one who discovered the most interesting and varied things.
          <br /><br />
          The potential action spaces in Tokaido are laid out on a linear track,
          with players advancing down this track to take actions. The player who
          is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on
          the track to their desired action and taking that action, so players
          must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or
          to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action
          spaces.
          <br /><br />
          The action spaces allow a variety of actions that will score in
          different, but roughly equal, ways. Some action spaces allow players
          to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money
          to acquire points. Other action spaces allow players to engage in
          various set collections that score points for assembling those sets.
          Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them,
          or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other
          types.
          <br /><br />
          All of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a
          unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in
          its play.
