          Cthulhu Wars is a strategy boardgame in which the players take the
          part of alien races and gods taken from the Cthulhu mythos created by
          H. P. Lovecraft. The game is physically large, and includes sixty-four
          figurines of the cultists, monsters, aliens, and Great Old Ones that
          range in height from approximately 20 mm to nearly 180 mm.
          <br /><br />
          The game takes place on a map of Earth. Each player takes the part of
          one of four factions included in the base game. At the start of a
          turn, players Gather Power, then, during a series of Action Rounds,
          they spend this Power to accomplish various tasks, such as recruiting
          Cultists, moving units, engaging in battle, summoning monsters,
          building Gates, casting spells, and Awakening their Great Old One.
          When all players run out of Power, the Action phase ends and the next
          turn begins. Victory is determined by accumulating points on the Doom
          Track. The first player to 30 is the lone victor *if* he has unlocked
          all six of spell books.
          <br /><br />
          Driving the strategy are a player's wish to expand his power base, and
          his need to accomplish six tasks to acquire his faction's spell books.
          Each faction has a unique set of monsters, spell books, and special
          abilities, and has different requirements to acquire its spell books.
          All factions have multiple strategies open to them.
          <br /><br />
          The base game supports 2-4 players (the map supports 5 players), but
          with new factions and maps released as expansions it can support up to
          8 players.
