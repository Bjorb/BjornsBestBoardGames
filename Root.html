          Root is a game of adventure and war in which 2 to 4 (1 to 6 with the
          'Riverfolk' expansion) players battle for control of a vast
          wilderness.
          <br /><br />
          The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on
          harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the
          forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its
          resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance
          may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move
          through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize
          with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough
          to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.
          <br /><br />
          Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have
          found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume
          their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will
          decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to
          decide which group will ultimately take root.
          <br /><br />
          Root represents the next step in our development of asymmetric design.
          Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique
          capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of
          gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been
          more accessible.
          <br /><br />
          In Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each
          role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability.
          Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world
          of Root!
