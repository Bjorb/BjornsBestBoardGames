          "You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small
          pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents,
          however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more
          pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You
          want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums.
          All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on
          anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them
          under your banner.
          <br /><br />
          But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have
          had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed
          land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will
          hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the
          coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your
          grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted."
          <br /><br />
          —description from the back of the box
          <br /><br />
          In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of
          cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the
          players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of
          cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the
          players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most
          efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.
