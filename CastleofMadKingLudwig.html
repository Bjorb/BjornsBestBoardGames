          In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked
          with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of
          Bavaria...one room at a time. You see, the King loves castles, having
          built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park
          castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the
          biggest, best castle ever — subject, of course, to his ever-changing
          whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms
          to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other
          players.
          <br /><br />
          In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes
          on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a
          set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him
          getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid
          him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who
          built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room
          constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the
          room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other
          rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.
          <br /><br />
          After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder
          who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game
          ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals,
          having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the
          King's demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most
          castle points wins.
