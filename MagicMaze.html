          After being stripped of all their possessions, a mage, a warrior, an
          elf, and a dwarf are forced to go rob the local Magic Maze shopping
          mall for all the equipment necessary for their next adventure. They
          agree to map out the labyrinth in its entirety first, then find each
          individual’s favorite store, and then locate the exit. In order to
          evade the surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival
          suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists simultaneously, then
          dash to the exit. That's the plan anyway…but can they pull it off?
          <br /><br />
          Magic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game. Each player can control
          any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to
          which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new
          area, ride an escalator… All this requires rigorous cooperation
          between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes
          prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate only for short
          periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without
          giving any visual or audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes
          succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for
          the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins
          together.
          <br /><br />
          At the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take
          actions. Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more
          time. If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the
          game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security
          guards nab you!
