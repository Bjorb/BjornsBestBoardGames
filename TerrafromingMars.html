          In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant
          corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate
          huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the
          ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming
          Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the
          terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are
          awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also
          for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and
          doing other commendable things.
          <br /><br />
          The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred
          different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can
          represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling
          asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of
          Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the
          atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as
          increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also
          have requirements and they become playable when the temperature,
          oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so
          there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and
          actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41
          megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always
          available to complement your cards.
          <br /><br />
          Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your
          Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you
          raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is
          complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many
          other sources.
