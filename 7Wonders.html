          You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World.
          Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military
          supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which
          will transcend future times.
          <br /><br />
          7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards
          from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the
          remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards
          simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or
          interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have
          individual boards with special powers on which to organize their
          cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses
          another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats
          until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages,
          the game ends.
          <br /><br />
          In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have
          immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in
          the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some
          provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give
          nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after
          being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving
          and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards
          are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an
          eye on the neighbors in both directions.
          <br /><br />
          Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3–7 players,
          there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.
