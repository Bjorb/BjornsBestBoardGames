          In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that
          is simply too small to accommodate them all.
          <br />br Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his
          award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of
          characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even
          humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent
          lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.
          <br /><br />
          Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and
          20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often
          at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to
          push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new
          one to victory!
          <br /><br />
          On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race
          (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories -
          possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on
          your race letting it go "into decline". A race in decline is
          designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.
          <br /><br />
          At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory
          your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in
          decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary
          depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories
          they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins
          wins.
